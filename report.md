## Description 
In this project, the focus was on developing a comprehensive cardiovascular prediction and analysis system. The goal was to explore the relationships between various health indicators and the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. The project involved data set loading, cleaning, transformation, exploration, and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict cardiovascular outcomes.


## Key Features
#### Data Exploration:
Deep dive into relationships between age, cholesterol, weight, glucose, blood pressure, gender, and cardiovascular diseases.
#### Machine Learning Models: 
Implemented logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms for accurate cardiovascular predictions.
#### Data Visualization: 
Utilized visualizations such as heatmaps to aid in feature selection and understanding relationships.
## Guide
Simply follow the steps outlined in my heart.ipynb for a sequential execution. Details are as follows:
Data Set Loading: Begin by loading the provided cardiovascular dataset.

Data Cleaning: Apply filtering and transformation steps to preprocess the data.

Data Exploration: Explore relationships through visualizations and analysis.

Machine Learning Prediction: Use the implemented algorithms for cardiovascular predictions.


## Installation Instructions
Classic libraries used in my heart.ipynb need to be installed, and these libraries are the most common ones.

## Code Review
My code includes detailed comments for better understanding and review.

### Major Challenges
The most challenging part involved data analysis and related components. Additionally, setting up a comprehensive framework suitable for machine learning training was not an easy task. Despite facing these challenges, I take particular pride in successfully completing the entire project.
